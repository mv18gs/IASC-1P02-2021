                <p>Hi! My name is <strong>Marcus Villena</strong>, and I am entering into my fourth year of <em>Biomedical Sciences</em> at Brock University. Like many of my peers, I had entered into my undergraduate studies due to my interest in exploring the scientific principles behind medicinal sciences, while also finding fulfilment in using this knowledge to help aid, communicate, and connect with those in my community. On the side, I have also enjoyed creating digital art and creative multimedia, ranging from photography and videography to learning digital painting and 3D modelling. While I had always felt that this creative aspect was to be kept to the side, it was not until the end of my third year when I discovered about the field of medical illustration and scientific communication through my peers and instructors. I quickly connected with students and professionals in the field, learning and exploring its work, and ultimately became enamoured with the idea and future prospect of utilizing my skills in both biomedical science and creative applications to contribute to the field of medical illustration. </p>

        <h3>About Medical Illustration</h3>
          <p><strong>Medical illustration</strong>, and related fields such as <em>biocommunication</em> and <em>scientific visualization</em>, is an interdisciplinary field which connects the sciences with visual communications. Medical illustrators work in collaboration with scientists, physicians, public health, and more, to translate new findings and complex information to a wide variety of audiences. </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Within <strong>research</strong>, medical illustrators play a pivotal role in the communication and <em>translation</em> of novel findings to other researchers, professionals, and lay audiences. Medical illustrators can help bring more citations and interactions with a researcher’s work, aid in the transfer of knowledge to other experts and audiences outside of the field, and overall can help in the student recruitment and grant application process.
            </li>
            <li>
              In <strong>education</strong>, medical illustrators translate complex concepts within the sciences into <em>educational media, textbooks,</em> and <em>visuals</em> to benefit both student and staff education regarding their ability to understand and communicate such knowledge.
            </li>
            <li>
              In <strong>health applications</strong>, medical illustrators work with physicians, researchers, public health, and other allied health professionals in illustrating and visualizing complex diseases, injury, treatments, and procedures to <em>help convey information</em> to lay audiences, patients, the general public, and even other healthcare workers.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>Overall</strong>, medical illustration supports the research and applied practice of the life sciences in effectively sharing and communicating scientific knowledge to diverse audiences. Medical illustrations help make life sciences <em>more approachable</em> to students, trainees and the general public; aid in the networking, collaboration and knowledge transfer between professionals; and overall build and engage communities surrounding around the life sciences as a whole.</p>

        <h3>What do medical illustrators do?</h3>
          <p>The field is changing rapidly due to discoveries in both <strong>science</strong> and <strong>technology</strong>. From the human genome to the latest robotic surgical technique, the <em>need for accurate effective communication</em> continues to expand.</p>
          <p>In the past, the majority of medical illustrators were employed at <em>large medical centers</em> where they worked closely with physicians to produce illustrations for publications such as medical textbooks and scientific journals, as well as instructional videos, films, presentations, and exhibits.</p>
          <p>Now, advances in <strong>computer graphics</strong> and <strong>imaging</strong> are generating vast new opportunities in which visualization is the key to understanding. Sub-cellular processes too small to be seen even by the most advanced microscopes can come alive through computer animations. A growing need for patients to <em>better understand</em> their state of health and their medical options is expanding the production of medical information aimed at the lay public. The Internet and wireless technology enables information to be widely and readily available on displays that rely on simplified but sophisticated graphics. Attorneys use medical illustration to clarify complex medical information for judges and juries in personal injury and medical malpractice cases.</p>
          <p>So, while many medical illustrators still produce illustrations for books and journals, others now act as <strong>art directors</strong> and <strong>producers</strong> of a broad range of work from animations and patient education programs to advanced computerized training simulations.</p>

        <h3>Do medical illustrators specialize?</h3>
          <p>Medical illustration is a small field with fewer than an estimated <em>2,000 trained practitioners</em> in the world. Yet, medical illustration is also a diverse field with most professionals developing <strong>specialties</strong>. Some specialize by subject matter, such as surgery, veterinary medicine, or ophthalmology. Others specialize by media, such as computer animation or the making of three-dimensional models. Others specialize by targeting specific markets such as medical publishing, pharmaceutical advertising, or medical-legal work. Medical illustrators develop considerable knowledge and expertise within their specialty and become an integral part of the production team. Some medical illustrators are authors and co-authors of textbooks or articles in which they've made major contributions to the content.</p>

        <h3>Where do medical illustrators work?</h3>
          <p>Approximately <em>one third</em> of medical illustrators are <strong>self-employed</strong>. They may work primarily alone or they may form creative teams, perhaps with allied professionals such as writers, graphic designers, photographers, or filmmakers. Other medical illustrators work at medical schools, hospitals and clinics, research institutions, medical publishers, law firms, advertising agencies, web/animation firms, and other creative services businesses.</p>
          <p>Some medical illustrators evolve throughout their careers into <strong>leadership positions</strong> as art directors, managers, administrators, faculty members, and business owners.</p>

        <h3>How are medical illustrators trained?</h3>
          <p>The majority of medical illustrators in the profession have a <strong>master's degree</strong> from an accredited two-year graduate program in medical illustration. There are currently four programs in North America that are accredited by the <em>Commission on Accreditation of Allied Health Education Programs</em> (CAAHEP). Each program accepts 20 or fewer students each year, so entrance into the schools is very competitive.</p>
          <p>Course work varies somewhat from program to program, but all include a combination of <strong>basic science courses</strong> in anatomy, pathology, microanatomy, physiology, embryology, and neuroanatomy, along with <em>specialized applied art courses</em> such as surgical illustration. Other classes include color theory, instructional design, photography, interactive media development, 3-D modeling and web design, along with traditional drawing and computer applications.</p>
          <p>Most programs require <strong>master's thesis projects</strong> and may have optional courses available in specialty fields such as advanced computer and video graphics, endoscopic illustration, or patient prosthetics.</p>
          <p>An increasing number of medical illustrators are choosing to obtain PhD degrees in related fields of <strong>science</strong> or <strong>education</strong>, particularly those working in <em>academic settings</em>.</p>
